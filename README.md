# Nichola Saputra - Full-stack Developer

A happy full-stack developer who likes to have fun😁.

I work on many projects, ranging from blog applications, Point on Sale etc. Right now I'm learning javascript and I'm also busy creating the Mblitaran API which allows developers to retrieve data on tourist attractions in the blitar area. 

See all my previous projects and my complete experience at [dev-nichola.my.id](https://dev-nichola.my.id)

## Thanks for Coming🤗
